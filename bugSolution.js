The solution is to optimize the height calculation by using the `getItemLayout` prop to provide a consistent height for each item. 
This method tells `FlatList` the height of each item beforehand.  Here is an example of how to use `getItemLayout`:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <View style={{ height: itemHeight }}>
      {/* Item content */}
    </View>
  )}
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => ({
    length: itemHeight,
    offset: itemHeight * index,
    index,
  })}
/>
```

Where `itemHeight` is a constant or a function that calculates a consistent height for all items. If the height depends on the item content, ensure that you calculate it before rendering, perhaps by pre-processing the `data` array to include pre-calculated heights.
