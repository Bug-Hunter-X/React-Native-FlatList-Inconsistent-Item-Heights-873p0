# React Native FlatList Inconsistent Item Heights

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native's FlatList component related to inconsistent item heights and provides a solution.

## Problem
The `FlatList` component, when rendering items with dynamically calculated heights, can exhibit unpredictable behavior. Items might overlap, scrolling might be incorrect, and overall layout can be broken.

## Solution
The solution involves optimizing the height calculation process for each item. This includes using techniques like memoization to avoid redundant calculations and ensuring that the height is correctly calculated before rendering each item.  Using `getItemLayout` prop can significantly improve performance and prevent layout inconsistencies.
